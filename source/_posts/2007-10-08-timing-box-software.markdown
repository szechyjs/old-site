The software is coming along rather well. I.m still waiting on the chip to come in, it should be waiting for me when I get home. I can then bust out the breadboard and finish things up. A friend also suggested that I make the software capable of doing lap times rather than times for single laps. So I think I will make the software function in 2 different modes. One of which, like it already is, stops the timer completely when the gate is tripped a second time. The new mode, would allow the timer to continue when the gate is tripped a second time and it will store the lap times for each lap, keep count of laps, and the overall time for all laps.
